"""
feature_patcher.py â€” generate model-ready diffs & coherence features
Inputs:
  data/UPCOMING_7D_enriched.csv
Outputs:
  data/UPCOMING_7D_features.csv

What it does (best-effort, schema-agnostic):
- Diffs (home - away) for selected signals:
    spi_rank_diff, injury_index_diff, lineup_availability_diff,
    keeper_psxg_prevented_diff, passing_accuracy_diff
- Market features:
    market_dispersion (bookmaker_count), has_ou/has_btts/has_spread (from enrichment)
    btts_price_gap (abs difference if both present)
- Coherence features:
    ou_vs_1x2_expected_goals (proxy: OU total vs implied 1X2 goal proxy)
Notes:
- If a source column is missing, the feature becomes NaN.
